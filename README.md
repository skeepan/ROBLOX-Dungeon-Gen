This is a pretty neat procedural dungeon generation demo I wrote in ROBLOX before I went to university. I have edited it a bit over time to make some things neater but my retrospective lack of OOP knowledge before attending university really shows so don't take this as a reflection of my OOP (Java!) skills!.
Now that ROBLOX has added Type Checking to Luau, I have slowly added some Types to make things clearer. 
You can play the game here : https://www.roblox.com/games/7827284659/TD-3P-Demo, where it will generate a randomised map for you.
